FEW THINGS LEFT TO RECHECK IN DISCUSSION:

stress more that we do much better than previous methods?


about trade-off between many parameters: also valid for more complex DCM 

One important thing in my opinion about the classification of subjects is that they are so separable (already in FC but even more in EC) That actually random links perform quite well. We don’t stress this much because we don’t have any plot about that. Of course, you can find discriminative networks in DMN or wherever you want, they are all over the brain...

DMN / global workspace / consciousness

have to say something more in Discussion about linear (MLR) versus non-linear (1NN) classification

tenemos que decir algo de la comparación del número de links para clasificación perfecta contra el número de PCs 

TO STRESS (RESULTS/DISCUSSION): 
- because we use z-scores, what discriminates between subjects/conditions is the ranking of the estimated EC weights (irrespective of the spread of the EC distribution); this means that subjects differ by the place of specific EC connections in the whole-brain ranking
- the perfect classification says that the discriminative EC patterns are very stable
- band-pass filtering does not prevent stable lags between BOLD signals
